            <p>This article showed that apple have upgraded several kinds of its products. Apple introduced Apple Pencil Pro, which supports gyroscope for a better control of the pen. It also showed new magic keyboard which would be thinner and lighter. Apple announced a new iPad Pro which has a new chip and updated cameras better in document scanning. It also presented new iPad Air which the front-facing camera will now be on the landscape edge and the iPads will have spatial audio.</p>
            <p>I think Apple’s value is going to increase for the next few days, because it has lots of new products released which would attract customers to buy. In this case, Apple can earn more money.</p>

            <p>I think it is good for NVIDIA to make collaboration with DaVinci Resolve to improve the editing experience so that more editors would purchase NVIDIA’s product aiming to seek for a better editing experience, which allows NVIDIA to make more profit.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>The sales revenue of NVIDIA had a slight increase which seems that the sales are maintained well, but the gross income decreased a lot which is abnormal compared to recent years. The net income even cut more than half than last year, and I believe it’s probably caused by the decrease in gross income. Another reason is that the US Government restricted shipment of GeForce RTX 4090 to China which let NVIDIA lost lots of customers.</p>

            <p>On the website, the company showed its system map, which indicates how far their service is reached. It also showed that their service range is bigger than their major competitor, CPKC. By showing the supply chain, it illustrated how their delivery works. By listing statistic data about its services, it shows how well the company did. They also introduced the Falcon Premium which is a Canada-US-Mexico Intermodal Service and some other featured services at the headline of the main page, aiming to attract customers' attraction and build desire from them to use their service to deliver goods.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>The sales growth and gross income both decreased a bit last year, maybe because of the decreasing need of transporting goods via rail last year. On another hand, CN made a net income growth of almost 10% which is good for them and I believe it’s because of the low expenditure needed for carrying less goods.</p>

            <p>This article showed that Royal Bank of Canada wants to have collaboration with the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. The TRREB would like to use RBC’s PayEdge to achieve a fast, seamless, and secure payment process. It also allows real estate brokerages to receive money by a more efficient and secure way rather than using cheques. </p>
            <p>I think by letting other companies using its PayEdge service, the RBC would earn a lot of money from the service. Besides, PayEdge also allows money transmission much more convenient, which reduced the loss generated through the paying process.</p>

          <p>First of all, I would like to put 10%, or $10,000, for Apple. Although it's a large cap stock, its net income last year was pretty bad. Another reason is that there wasn't a huge increase over the last year.</p>
          <p>Next, I would like to put 40%, or $40,000, for NVIDIA. Although it's a large cap stock, I appreciate how the value of the stock had grew over last year. Also, the data of adjacent year (2022 and 2024 up till now) is so outstanding for investing. Also, the company introduced stock split recently which is friendly for me to afford the stock.</p>
          <p>Then, I would like to put 30%, or $30,000, for Candadian national Railway Company. In its 2023 income statement, the company made a considerable increase in net income, which indicates that the company is making money and I believe that by investing this stock, I can make a decent amount of money. Also, this company is responsible for transporting goods across Canada and sometimes including United States and even Mexico, and its system map, or service range is much more bigger than its main competitor, CPKC.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to put 20%, or $20,000, for Royal Bank of Canada. Through the income statement last year, it made lots of money, which indicates that the stock is in good condition. On another hand, over the past year, the value of this stock is also growing bigger and bigger, and I believe that by investing this stock, I can earn lots of money.</p>
